Mocking
=======

For leeson 6 - Chay Casso - an explanation of what MagicMock actually does, as well as possibly some instruction on how to deal with import statements covering different directories as per the Lesson 6 exercise.

See examples

MagicMock is a subclass of Mock with default implementations of most of the magic methods. You can use MagicMock without having to configure the magic methods yourself.

Directories
===========
For lesson 6 - Marc Charbonneau - in video linting. He creates a directory and in the directory there is a file called pycache. He then modifies his imports statements. Would it possible to go over what he did and why.
