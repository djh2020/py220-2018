For Lesson 5- Ken Murray, I was not able to get the pdb debugger to function. please give us a demo.
I kept getting a syntax error when I tried to follow the video. - Ken Murray

```
python -m pdb xxx.py
```

Could use help with having multiple formatters for different handlers. Thought I did it right but can't seem to get it working.

For lesson 6 - Marc Charbonneau - in video linting. 
He creates a directory and in the directory there is a file called __pycache__. He then modifies his imports statements. Would it possible to go over what he did and why.

For leeson 6 - Chay Casso - an explanation of what MagicMock actually does, as well as possibly some instruction on how to deal with import statements covering different directories as per the Lesson 6 exercise.
