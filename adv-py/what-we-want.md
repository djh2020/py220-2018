Still working on Module 7 homework and how best to query data in the DB. If we could review some of the examples listed here: http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/querying.html that would be great. In particular how best to use 'get' and 'select'. Still running into problems with those two specifically. 
Made some progress with peewee. have been playing with different iterators and I am happpy to share my experiences
Michael shared a great tip helping me figure out syntax issue.  (it resulted in me openning an issue with peewee and getting it fixed)
